# control-the-direction-of-a-robot


## Introduction
In this project, we will develop a web page to control the direction of a robot and connect it to a database. The aim is to provide an interactive user interface that allows users to easily direct the robot and monitor its status in real-time. All commands and data related to the robot's movement will be stored in a database to facilitate tracking and analysis.

## Project Description
User Interface:

Design a simple and user-friendly interface for controlling the robot's direction (e.g., forward, backward, left, right).

Display the robot's current status, such as its position and speed.

Database Integration:

Store all commands sent to the robot in the database.
Log movement data for retrieval and analysis.

Real-Time Interaction:

Use technologies like WebSocket to update the robot's status in real-time.
Ensure all changes are reflected on the interface immediately.
This system will enable effective and reliable control of the robot, with the ability to analyze data for performance improvement and future decision-making.
